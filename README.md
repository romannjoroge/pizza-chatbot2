# Regular Show Christmas Special Emulator

This project was made to take the new Google Gemini API for a spin. The goal of the project is to allow the users to interact with the main cast of Season 8 of regular show i.e Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Pops, Muscle Man, High 5 Ghost, Benson and Aileen.

The project is meant to make the user feel like they have been thrown into a typical Regular Show Christmas Special where the characters can tell christmas stories but the user pitch into the story.
